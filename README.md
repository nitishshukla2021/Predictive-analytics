📈 Predictive Analytics: Stock Price Forecasting

This repository focuses on time series–based stock price forecasting using historical market data of Tesla and Tata Motors.

The project applies predictive analytics techniques to analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in stock prices. After preprocessing and making the data stationary, ARIMA models are trained to forecast future stock prices.

Key objectives of this project:

Understand stock price behavior using historical data

Apply statistical time series models for forecasting

Compare model performance on different stocks

Visualize actual vs predicted prices for better interpretation

This project demonstrates practical application of time series analysis in financial data and strengthens skills in predictive modeling and analytics.
